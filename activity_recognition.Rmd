#Synopsis 
 
Activity trackers make possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
 
In this paper we are going to build a model that can predict the manner in which people did the exercise. We use  dataset, generously provided by Groupware@LES in [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201).
